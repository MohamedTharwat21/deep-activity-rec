 ● Implementation #1
            ○ Use the classifier of B1-tuned (Baseline-1) to extract representation per clip
    ■ Use 9 frames per each Clip
    ■ Now you have sequence for each clip of 9 steps
            ○ Now train an LSTM on these sequences
            ○ Start with this implementation.

            this Implementation Gives me Accuarcy = 
            [Test Loss: 0.8057, Test Accuracy: 75.47% ] on testing dataset


            --------------------------

 ● Implementation #2
            ○ Extend the classifier network directly with an LSTM layer then classification
            ○ This way no need to do explicit features extraction
