This baseline 3 (Fine-tuned an image classifier over 9 actions[person classification]) 
which is a 3 steps :

A : fine tune image classifier over 9 classes 
    your input will be a cropped image 


B : infernce : for an image 
              - get all the person crops 
              - feat. extraction for each crop (2048 features of resnet50)
              - Maxpool all the features == now you have an image representation


C : Do NN training on these features over 9 classes .

Results : 
        - For step A , first finetuned resnet50 classifier on 9 classes 
        gives 

        - for the second classifier (which representation of the whole image) 

        - this after many trials of changing the configrations 
        like : Hyperparameters , data splitting (undersample and upsample) , trying
        different optimizers .

        - the model of (b3 is still under developement to get more accurate results 
        in the second classifier )
