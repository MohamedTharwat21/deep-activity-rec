Baseline B5
    ● Temporal on crops (LSTM on player level)
    ● Similar 2 implementation paths to build representation per person
    ● You can represent each clip with the last hidden state
    ● Max pool all players representations (9 per image)
    ● Then do the NN network exactly like in B3 (on images)
            ○ Features classifier - no temporal info

--  first we take the classifier which was in baseline 3 (person level) to use it in 
    feature extraction. [b3_first_trained_model_v1 == name of the directory]
    
    model_path = r'/kaggle/input/b3-first-trained-model-v1-4732598a/b3_trained_model_v1.pth'
