info for B7 and B8 :
    -- i will not use the new extracted features from the
         modified b3 model as i did in the previous Baselines .
    -- i will keep using the old features , as the new ones 
         do not make any improvements

about this Baseline (B7 - full model)
     Baseline B7
     ● Full model V1
     ● A) train LSTM on crops level   (LSTM on a player)
                              
     ● B) extract clips: sequence of 9 steps per player
     ● C) for each frame, properly max pool its players
     ● C) train LSTM 2 on the frame level

     more details : 
       -- Lstm1 : 
          i will use the extracted features of the b3 classifier (person level)
          which shape is (9 * 12 * 2048 ) then train lstm on person level , but
          take care that we want to have dimensions of (lstm input is 2048 and hidden state 
          2048 of the same dimensions , then use the trained lstm to extract features on the person level
          so we will use the previous 9 * 12 * 2048 as input for the trained lstm 
          to product 9 * 12 * 2048 output shape , then maxpool on the player dimension then we
          will have 9 * 2048 output shape representing the whole scene (frame)  )

       -- Lstm2 : 
          it will be on the frame level which is 9 * 2048 to classify this sequence over 8 classes
